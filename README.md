## 👋 Hey! I'm Jakub Beneš, a Software Engineer based in Prague.

I'm passionate about scaling engineering, organizational design, and leadership. I'm a huge fan of web technologies and modern approaches within this field. While I'm a strong contributor on the frontend side, lately, I've been focusing more on the entire stack and infrastructure because there's often low-hanging fruit that can deliver a massive impact – and I enjoy seizing such opportunities. I'm not sure if I'll ever start liking YAML, though. 🤓
