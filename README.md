###  ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Jakub BeneÅ¡, Staff Engineer at [Productboard](https://www.productboard.com/), based in Prague.

I'm passionate about scaling engineering, organization design, and fighting Conway law ðŸ˜ˆ. I'm a huge fan of web technologies and modern approaches. Although I still consider myself a frontend-heavy engineer, I'm lately focusing much more on the whole stack and infra because there's often low-hanging fruit in terms of massive impact. I'm not sure if I ever start liking a YAML, though #CriesInHelmChart. 

If you'd like to know more or follow my ðŸ’­ thoughts more closely â€“ [check my Twitter](https://twitter.com/jukben). Feel free to drop me some DM or anything, I'd be more than happy to hear from you!
