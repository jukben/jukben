## 👋 Hey! I'm Jakub Beneš, Software Engineer based in Prague.

I'm passionate about scaling engineering, organization design, and leadership. I'm a huge fan of web technologies and modern approaches within this field. Although I still consider myself a frontend-heavy engineer, I'm lately focusing much more on the whole stack and infra because there's often a low-hanging fruit that can deliver massive impact. I like to unlock such an opportunity. I'm not sure if I ever start liking a YAML, though. 🤓
